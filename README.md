# TL;DR [![AHM flow (all steps)](https://github.com/paritytech/ahm-dryrun/actions/workflows/zombie-bite.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paritytech/ahm-dryrun/actions/workflows/zombie-bite.yml)

To run AHM for Kusama or Polkadot using Zombie-Bite:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:paritytech/ahm-dryrun.git && \
cd ahm-dryrun && \
just init && \
just setup && \
just ahm kusama || echo "Setup failed"
```

# Just commands

- `just` to see the list of commands
- `just init` to initialize the repo
- `just setup` to install dependencies
- `just ahm [polkadot|kusama]` to run the Migration for a given runtime. No args prints the help menu.
- `just zb [bite|spawn|perform-migration]` to run the Zombie-Bite commands. No args prints the help menu.
- `just e2e-tests` to run the E2E tests

## AHM Flows (manual steps)

The cmd `just ahm <runtime>` uses the `orchestrator` as main control flow to coordinate the usage of a mix of tools (e.g:[zombie-bite](https://github.com/pepoviola/zombie-bite), [doppelganger](https://github.com/paritytech/doppelganger-wrapper)) and `ts` scripts (under zombie-bite-scripts), but those are designed to allow you to use (and _reuse_) each _component_ manully in order to easily debug each __step__.

### Requirements
In order to use this tool you will need these binaries available in your PATH:

- [Doppelganger binaries](https://github.com/paritytech/doppelganger-wrapper): doppelganger, doppelganger-parachain, workers
- [Zombie-bite](https://github.com/pepoviola/zombie-bite)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v22 or higher)

This tools are installed as part of the `setup` command.

### Defining the `base_path`

One important concept to run all the needed steps is defining the `base_path`, this will be the directory where all the intermedia _artifacts_ will be stored, and each of the tools allow to pass the _path_ as argument.

### Step 0: `bite` the live network

The _first_ step consists of _biting_ a live network, and once completed, creating the _artifacts_ needed to _spawn_ a new instance of this network (rc/ah) and ensure block production.

In order to run _step 0_, you can run:

```bash
just zb bite <base_path> <polkadot|kusama>

e.g: just zb bite ./migration-run polkadot
```

This will run `zombie-bite`, storing the resulting _artifacts_ under `<base_path>/bite` (e.g: ./migration-run/bite) directory.
This directory should contain these files:

- `config.toml` : zombienet compatible configuration to spawn an instance of the network.
- `<runtime>-spec.json` : chain-spec of the relaychain.
- `asset-hub-<runtime>-spec.json` : chain-spec of AH.
- `<runtime>-snap.tgz` : Db snapshot of the relaychain.
- `asset-hub-<runtime>-snap.tgz` : Db snapshot of AH.


_NOTE_: this step performs a _warp_ sync of both rc/ah and can take some time (20/25 mins on avg. for polkadot).


### Step 1: `spawn` network instance (and perform migration)

Once _step 0_ is completed, you will have all the needed artifacts to spawn a new instance of the _bitten_ networks (as many times as you want) with the command:

```bash
just zb spawn <base_path>

e.g: just zb spawn ./migration-run
```

This will run `zombie-bite` to _spawn_ a new instance of the _bitted_ network and will print the network info (with direct links for `pjs`/`papi`).

#### Step 1.1 Perform migration

Since the last step _spawn_ the network and _capture_ the terminal, you need open a new terminal instance to run the next _sub-steps_.
In order to perform the migration, you need to run the following command:

```bash
just zb perform-migration <base_path>

e.g: just zb perform-migration ./migration-run
```

This will trigger the migration and a monitoring script that will keep checking the `stage` of the migration until completion.

Once the migration is completed, the network instance spawned as part of _step 1_ will be terminated and all the needed artifacts to spawn a new instance (with the _post_ migration step) will be created in the `<base_path>/spawn` (e.g: ./migration-run/spawn) directory.

- `config.toml` : zombienet compatible configuration to spawn an instance of the network.
- `<runtime>-spec.json` : chain-spec of the relaychain.
- `asset-hub-<runtime>-spec.json` : chain-spec of AH.
- `<runtime>-snap.tgz` : Db snapshot of the relaychain.
- `asset-hub-<runtime>-snap.tgz` : Db snapshot of AH.

__Also__: after the migration is done a file called `migration_done.json` will be generated in the __base_path__ with the block height (of both rc/ah) where the migration was completed.

The content of the file will be:

```json
{
    "rc_finish_block": <block number>,
    "ah_finish_block": <block number>
}
```

### Step 2: `spawn` network instance (and run post-migration tests)

The last step is running the _post_ migration tests, but first you need to _spawn_ an instance of the network (with the state from the previous step) with this command:

```bash
just zb spawn <base_path> post

e.g: just zb spawn ./migration-run post
```

This will spawn a new instance of the network (with the state of the previous step) and will print all the network info (ports) to run the _post migration_ tests.

Then you can run the test in a _different terminal_.

### E2E Tests on Westend Asset Hub

Polkadot Ecosystem Tests offers, among other things, a suite of E2E tests that run against live networks.
The PET submodule in this repository is set to branch `ahm-tests`, which adapts the (originally) relay chain E2E suites
to run in post-migration Asset Hubs

In order to run PET tests on the post-migration Asset Hub chain of a network created by `zombie-bite`, assume it is
named `<network-name>`, and do the following:

1. Start the network with `just zb spawn <base_path> post` (if it is not already running)
2. Note the port number `<collator-port>` the collator is running on, and the `<block-number>` the AH chain is on
3. in `./polkadot-ecosystem-tests/.env`, add the following data
    ```sh
    ASSETHUB<network-name>_ENDPOINT=ws://[::1]:<collator-port>
    ASSETHUB<network-name>_BLOCK_NUMBER=<block-number>
    ```
4. Run `just e2e-tests packages/<network-name>`

The AHM has already occurred on Westend, so there, you can ignore all steps but the last.

#### Notes on E2E `just e2e-tests` command

It accepts multiple arguments, which are then passed to `yarn` to further specify the scope of the tests.

```sh
# runs every PET test
# this will run the adapted test suites on Polkadot/Kusama, and **cause failures** as test suites for AH are
# incompatible with relaychain
just e2e-tests

# run every test that exists for Kusama chains: relay, AH
just e2e-tests packages/kusama
# run every test suite that exists for WAH, E2E or otherwise
just e2e-tests assetHubWestend
# run the E2E test suite for the scheduler pallet
just e2e-tests kusama.scheduler
just e2e-tests staking nominationPools
...
```

# Logs

You can find zombie-bite logs in `~/migration-run-*/sync-node/sync-node.log` or `~/migration-run-*/sync-node-para/sync-node-para.log` folders. `logs/` folder in turn
combine orchestrator logs with post-ahm testing logs. You can find different level of severance files there.

# Components overview

## Tech stack

- [Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) and PET for e2e functionality tests
- [PAPI](https://papi.how/) + PJS for orchstrating/controlling e2e AHM flow
- Zombie-Bite + Doppelganger for forking off the network and making migration blocks

## Migration tests

# Code Contributions
Make any changes to the env rather than to the bare configs.


## Updating submodules

Make sure to run `git submodule update --recursive` after you pull from the repo to update the submodules to the commits tracked in the repo.

You can run e.g. `cd runtimes && git checkout <commit_hash> && cd - && git add runtimes && git commit` to update the commit that the runtimes submodule points to.


# FAQ
## If you've already cloned `ahm-dryrun` repo but didn't use the recursive flag
You can run:
```
git submodule update --init
```

## Node/`npm` errors

If errors like

```
npm warn Unknown project config "// ensure node engine version". This will stop working in the next major version of npm.
npm error code EBADENGINE
npm error engine Unsupported engine
```

occur, an update to the local version of `node/npm` may be necessary.

## `zombie-bite` and nested logs

When shown a log line similar to

```
...
2025-08-07 16:21:55 [info]: 	 ‚öôÔ∏è Starting zombie-bite (üìì logs ./migration-run-1754580086/logs/zombie-bite.log)... {
...
```

note that the logs in the file mentioned may be static, and that for further information on the state of the process, a
nested log file, mentioned in the file above by path, should be opened.
