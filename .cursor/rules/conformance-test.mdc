The [code.py](mdc:conformance/code.py) file is doing automated code scanning to check whether some requirements are fulfilled.  
All storages need to have the requirements check somewhere for the mentioned `functionalities` in that file.

When a specific test does indeed fulfil one of those requirements, it should be marked in the form of:  
`// Assert storage "Pallet::StorageFor::when::what"` directly above the line that checks it.

Example:
```rust
// Assert storage "Preimage::PreimageFor::ah_post::correct"
assert!(alias::PreimageFor::<T>::contains_key((hash, len)));
```

It is possible to have multiple assertions for the same requirement - it will just be shown multiple times in the output.

Functional requirements are not yet supported but will be added soon.
